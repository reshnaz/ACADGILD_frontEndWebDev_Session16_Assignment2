This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

## Problem Statement
1. Create a form with 3 inputs, 1 dropdown field, and 1 field that which will
take the date and a button. Create a text box for searching the values from
the array.
2. The drop down filed values should display on initialization using services.
3. The input and the dropdown fields should use a Two-Way Binding. Create a
model for the fields and initialize them on ngOnInit().
4. Create a service for sending and retrieving the data.
5. Create a function which will bind with the (ngSubmit). Once you click on that
button, it should send the data in the parameter and should display the data
in View. Use pipe to show the date in 9/3/2010 this format.
6. Create a custom pipe to capitalize the first character of any one of the inputs
in the View.
7. Create a custom pipe for searching the values from the array as you enter
the values in the search text box.
8. Create a file in which define the routing configuration and routeroutlet.
9. Divide the file for adding the data and for viewing the data.
10. Define path and assign component accordingly.
11. Define default and wildcard routes.
12. Create a navbar with two text values and clicking on those values the page
should routes accordingly.
13. Create a path with route parameter.
14. On adding the values the page should navigate to the view routes.
15. On clicking any one of the data in the view it should pass the values the
route parameter and display the route parameter values in the view.
